## P1 — Cross-Model Regime Separation

P1 applies the same fixed evaluation engine to reasoning chains from different models
under equivalent prompts.

Observation:
- different models fall into different structural regimes (viable vs inflationary),
- the regime depends on trajectory structure, not model identity.
