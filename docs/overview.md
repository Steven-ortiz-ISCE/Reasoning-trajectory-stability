## Overview

Current evaluation methods focus on correctness or preferences.
This work evaluates **structural viability of reasoning trajectories**.

Key point:
- A response can be locally plausible yet structurally unstable.
- Structural failure can appear before semantic failure.

The method is semantic-agnostic and does not rely on labels or task-specific heuristics.
