# Structural Coherence Evaluation of Reasoning Trajectories (Research)

This repository documents a research effort focused on detecting **structural instability
in multi-step reasoning trajectories**, independent of semantic correctness or task success.

Core idea:
> Reasoning can fail **structurally** *before* failure is visible in outputs.
This work evaluates reasoning as **trajectories**, using pre-semantic structural signals derived from trajectory geometry.

This work evaluates reasoning as trajectories, using **pre-semantic structural signals derived from trajectory geometry**, rather than semantic correctness or task success.

## Included
- Conceptual overview (docs)
- Early structural separation experiments
- Cross-model consistency experiments
- Figures (figures/)

## Not included
- Core engine implementation
- Proprietary datasets
- Production API

This is a research artifact intended to communicate the evaluation concept clearly.
